# Controling the Rover

In this step, you will use the keyboard to move your rover up and down.

At the moment, you should see a scene with a robotic rover and a hilly background.

## Broadcasting Start Message

The rover will control the start of the game by broadcasting a start message when the green flag is clicked.

Add the code blocks below to your project and change the message to `start`.

## Adding Keyboard Controls

You are going to use the keyboard controls to make the rover look as if it is moving towards or away from the viewer.

Add the codeblocks below and change the broadcast message of each `code block`.

## Moving the Rover

When the up button is clicked or the up arrow is pressed, the rover should change its `y` position by a small amount. Increasing `y` will make the rover move up. Decreasing `y` will make the rover move down.

Add the code blocks below to your project.

==You don’t need to worry about the left and right motion yet. Left and right motion will be added in the next step of the project.==

## Adding Perspective

Perspective makes the rover appear further away when moving up and closer when moving down.

Add the code blocks below to your project.

!!! warning "Note"

    You’ll need to reset the rover’s size at the start of the game.
